"talk cambridge - this time we will only shortly cover the general topic
                  and instead dive deeper into discussion the next steps
		  as well as the end user view on reproducible builds."
mental summary: "the other 66%" 

(the first 33% = reproduible builds)
the 2nd 33% = actual rebuilders and sharing checksums securly and sanely
the last 33% = end user tools)

- adopt slide title, etc., add lamby, also his fingerprint
