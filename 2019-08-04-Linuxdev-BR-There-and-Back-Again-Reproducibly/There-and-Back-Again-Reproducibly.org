There and back again, reproducibly! (in English)
Linux Developer Conference, São Paulo, Brazil
2019-08-04, 14:45–15:25, Radisson Madrid

There is an epic journey from reviewed source code to the code you
actually run on your computer, and things can go quietly wrong along
the way!

We can't do absolutely everything ourselves by hand, so we necessarily
put trust into something somewhere along the way.

What happens to your code as it passes through dark forests,
trecherous mountain passes, or deep forboding caverns? What if
something is quietly corrupting an otherwise trustworthy ally? Help
showing up, but with it's own motives?

Reproducible Builds gives a project confidence that the journey from
source code to binary code gets you there and back again.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit
identical copies of all specified artifacts.

* Once upon a time

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- A list mail in 1997, very few more in 2001 and 2003.
- Then, in 2011 and 2012, Bitcoin and Torbrowser were made reproducible.
- Wow.

* Why unreproducibilities exist (historically)

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- Historically software was reproducible! Every bit counted.
- And every bit was known.
- Bit for bit reproducible GNU toolchain in the early 90s on 10(?) architectures.
- *And then we all forgot.*

* Debian

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- Then in 2013 some people in Debian started to investigate this.
- And kicked it off in 2014 by introducing systematic testing, classifications and weekly blogs.
- Since 2017 in Debian Policy, as a "should" directive, not "must".
- 2023 with "must"?

* Debian main unstable/amd64, since October 2014

[[./images/stats_pkg_state.png]]

* Shared research and developments / WIP

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- Test/research setup for many but not all projects.
- Since end of 2018 shared database for some of those.
- Sharing issues, patches and upstreaming them.
- Shared public blog, now called monthly report.
- More collaboration is possible!

* Why unreproducibilities exist

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- timestamps
- timestamps 
- timestamps
- build paths
- timezones, locales
- hundreds of classes of causes !
- It's fun to discover these! Well, mostly.

* A light at the end of the forest?

- Diffoscope!
- FIXME. explain. pics. urls.

* Theory vs Praxis

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- 93% is a lie.
- Getting software reproducible in theory is 33% of the way.
- The next 33% is to do it in practice, to change the distros tools and workflows. Not always easy.
- And the last 33% are about distributing trust and/or "Enable everyone to independently..." for real. And that again is different for each distro.

* Four summits so far

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- Athens 2015
- Berlin 2016
- Berlin 2017
- Paris 2018
- Marrakesh 2019

* Collaboration is so great, again.

[[./images/reprobuilds-display.jpeg]]

* Collaboration, again.

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- We stand on the shoulders of giants.
- And women, men and others,
- And elves and dwarves, 
- And wizards and hobbits,
- And beings beyond our current imagination,
- And we welcome you.
- And we welcome Free Software.

* The end / summary

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- We made 93% of the first 33%.
- Currently. There's new software every hour.
- And for some distros, half or a third of the 2nd 33%.
- There are ideas and even code for the last 33%, but we can't go on that path without the 2nd 33%...
- *There is a lot to do. Please. Help.*

* Questions?

Thank you for your time and contributions.

It's been a long journey but we will get there. And back again, on to new journeys!
