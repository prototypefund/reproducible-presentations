There and back again, reproducibly! (in English)

There is an epic journey from reviewed source code to the code you
actually run on your computer, and things can go quietly wrong along
the way!

We can't do absolutely everything ourselves by hand, so we necessarily
put trust into something somewhere along the way.

What happens to your code as it passes through dark forests,
trecherous mountain passes, or deep forboding caverns? What if
something is quietly corrupting an otherwise trustworthy ally? Help
showing up, but with it's own motives?

Reproducible Builds gives a project confidence that the journey from
source code to binary code gets you there and back again.

A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit
identical copies of all specified artifacts.
