* About reproducible builds

 - Packages with the same source code, built with the same toolchain, should come out identical.
 - reproducible-builds.org

* What lead to the creation of a monster?

 - u-boot was marked as reproducible
 - I knew it was wrong:

   U-Boot SPL 2016.01+dfsg1-3 (*Feb 21 2016 - 21:39:10*)

 - Handful of arm systems

* Humble Beginnings

 - In August of 2015, work was done to enable two dual-core and two
   quad-core build machines.

* It Lives!
 - In September, the network went live, building around 200 source
   packages a day.
 - With over 20,000 packages in the archive, it would take over 100
   days to build everything in unstable...

* The Monster Grows In Strength and Numbers

 - I bought a couple more boards...
 - Donation from beagleboard.org of a beagleboard-x15
 - In December 2015, the Debian Project Leader approved a proposal to
   triple the capacity of our build network.

* Recent Sightings

  [[./images/rack_20160630_010.jpg]]

* Current configuration
 - Three dual-core, 1gb ram 
 - Two quad-core, 1gb ram
 - Two dual-core, 2gb ram
 - Eight quad-core, 2gb ram
 - Three quad-core, ~4gb ram
 - Three octa-core, 2gb ram 

* How many Whatsits?

 (3*2)+(2*4)+(2*2)+(8*4)+(3*4)+(3*8) =

 *86 cores!!!!*

 (3*1)+(2*1)+(2*2)+(8*2)+(3*4)+(3*2) =

 *43 gb ram!!!!*

* Devouring the archive
 - Builds about 1400 or more packages a day!

 [[./images/stats_builds_per_day_armhf-2016-06-30.png]]

 - Builds unstable, testing and experimental in around 45 days.

* Building in Power

 - The whole armhf build network runs in under 180 watts!

* Space
 [[./images/heater_20160702_210953_1.jpg]]

 - A space heater used at debconf16 uses 400-800 watts!

* Hungry for Bandwidth

* Boards of a feather

  - Cubox-i4pro and i4x4
  - Hummingboard-i2ex
  - Wandboard Quad and Dual
  - Firefly-RK3288
  - Beagleboard-x15
  - Cubietruck
  - Bananapi
  - OrangePI Plus2
  - Raspberry PI 2
  - Odroid-XU4
  - Odroid-U3

* Platforms enabled in the Debian
  - linux: Odroid-U3, Firefly-RK3288, Odroid-XU4, BeagleBoard-X15
  - u-boot: Odroid-XU4, Firefly-RK3288, BeagleBoard-X15,
    Cubietruck plus, OrangePI plus
  - debian-installer: BeagleBoard-X15, Firefly-RK3288

* Platforms to pout about
  - lack mainline kernel and u-boot:
    - Cubieboard4, Odroid-C1+
  - lack mainline kernel:
    - Cubietruck plus, Lemaker HiKey
  - Non-free firmware blobs:
    - raspberry pi 2, Odroid-U3, Odroid-XU4, Odroid-C1+, Firefly(??)
  - Mainline u-boot support for all ram:
    - Firefly-RK3288 4gb variant, Cubox-i4x4

* In December of 2017, the reproducible build network became aware

  - Other boards:
    - Pine64, Odroid-C2
    - Lemaker Cello, HP Moonshot
  - Build archictecture-independent packages on different architecture
    for first and second build.
* By 2050...
  - The Autonomous Reproducible Build Network Produced a bit-for-bit
    copy of the entire earth.
* Thanks
  - Holger for all the work to integrate armhf and continued
    maintenance of jenkins.debian.net
  - Hardware donations: Debian, LeMaker, BeagleBoard.org Solid-Run
  - All the great reproducible builds folks!
