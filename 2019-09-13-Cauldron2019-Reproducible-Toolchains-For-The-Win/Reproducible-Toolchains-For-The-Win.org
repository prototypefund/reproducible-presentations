Reproducible Toolchains For The Win!

The Reproducible Builds project promotes a set of software development
practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to
binary code, by providing bit-for-bit identical results.

A key component in building software are the toolchains used. Solving
reproducibility issues at the toolchain level can sometimes fix
thousands of bugs in a single place, rather than patching each
individual affected package.

As an interesting side-effect, Reproducible Builds can also assist in
verifying license compliance.

This talk will mention some of the past and current issues in
toolchains needed to realize Reproducible Builds in the real world.
Let's work together to fix outstanding issues and further these
efforts!

A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build
environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit
identical copies of all specified artifacts.
