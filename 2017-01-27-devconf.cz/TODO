fsf priority project

ars technica
	debian is really stupid allowing developer build binaries to be uploaded from every developer
		just because its useful to bootstrap new archs, which something like 3 people do
	but the build network of fedora/redhat doesnt make things magically safe nor secure, OTOH its a ideal attack target… how much do you pay your admins? etc ;-)
