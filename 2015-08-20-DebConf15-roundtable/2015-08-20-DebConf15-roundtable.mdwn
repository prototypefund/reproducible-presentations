How to help Debian?
------------

 * Inventory issues and analyse them
 * Make packages build reproducibly
 * Fix known common issues:
     - Get reproducible PE binaries;
     - Random filenames with GCC;
 * Hack Debian archive infrastructure
     - Store and distribute `*.buildinfo` files (#763822))
           - our patch `dpkg` also ain't in the BTS yet
     - reproducibly should be mandated in debian-policy…
 * Hack tools to display local packages reproducibility status
 * We need a logo too :)
 * …

Thanks!
