- which screenshots to show?
  no screenshot but explicitly mention: 165 issues
  r.d.n/$src
  pkg set: build-essential

- emphasize we dont have a patch for dak? does it matter?
- mention "Append only logs (-> binary transparency logs)" ?
- merge "Status and next steps in Debian" slides?

- "I don't think" & "So I think" - *I*?



nice to have
------------
- improve on packages slide (2 patches per day...)
- variations
	kernel variations 3.16/4.1/2 vs 2.6.66
- next:
	send mail to that dam dak bug. NOW.
