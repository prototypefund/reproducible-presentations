- which screenshots to show?
  no screenshot but explicitly mention: 165 issues
  r.d.n/$src
  pkg set: build-essential

- merge "Status and next steps in Debian" slides?
	- emphasize we dont have a patch for dak? does it matter?
	  (if at "status and next steps"...)


nice to have: 
- variations:
    kernel variations 3.16/4.1/2 vs 2.6.66
    LANG=C 

- todo next:
	send mail to that dam dak bug. NOW.
