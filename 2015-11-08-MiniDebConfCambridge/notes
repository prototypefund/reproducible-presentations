- help wanted to reduce sudo usage
- emphasize we want more armhf+arm64 hw
- mention we only test main. question: is there a database which packages from contrib can be legally blindly build?

- Summary
-- we have shown that reproducible builds are doable in theory and practice.
-- we have patches (well, except for dak) to make 85% reproducible now.
-- "in theory"

- debian release process
-- in our current design and practices, rebuilding stretch will require package versions which are not part of stretch
-- this will also put a high load on snapshot.debian.org
-- rebuilding all of debian a month prio the release? I don't think the release team will like this.
-- so?

- no more source only uploads?
-- should people be forced again to always do binary uploads, which only will be accepted when the checksum matches?
-- probably not

- distributing .buildinfo files
-- probably 100000 files per suite, thats an 50% increase
-- mirrors would not be happy, so they should not go there
-- we'll need many more files though, when we have detached signatures
-- revoking sigs?

- rebuilders and sharing signed checksums
-- almost no work has been done here
-- individuelly signed checksums (think web of trust) could work in the Debian case (we have a gpg web of trust), but wont scale
-- so I think we need systematic rebuilders, run by large organisations (ACLU, NASA, NSA, Deutsche Bank, EDF & Greenpeace)
--- so we need automated installers and howtos for those who set up these builders
-- and then we a system to sign those checksums and share them
--- append only logs (-> binary transparency logs)

- end user tools
-- do you really want to install this unreproducible package? (y/N)
-- how many signed checksums do you require to call a package "reproducible"?
-- do you want to build those packages which unconfirmed checksums, before installing?
-- which rebuilders do you want to trust?
-- "rebuilders and sharing signed checksums" needs to be designed (and probably at least partly implemented) before thinking more about end user tools. It's just clear we need them.

- questions / room for discussion


- help needed
-- DSA offers to give us more hardware (other archs, ppc64el), but is (rightfully) unhappy with our over usage of sudo
-- please help


nice to have
------------
- improve on packages slide (2 patches per day...)
- variations
	kernel variations 3.16/4.1/2 vs 2.6.66
- next:
	send mail to that dam dak bug. NOW.
