* About reproducible builds

 - reproducible-builds.org
 - Packages with the same source code, built with the same toolchain,
   should come out identical.

* Source Code

  - Source code is readable and writeable by trained +monkeys+ humans
  - Computers run binary code
  - How do you know the binary code the computer is running was
    produced from the source code?

* Verification

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ python -c 'x=1 ; y=1 ; print(x+y)'
    2
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ python -c 'x=1 ; y=1 ; print(x+y)' | sha256sum
    53c234e5e8472b6ac51c1ae1cab3fe06fad053beb8ebfd8977b010655bfdd3c3  -
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ echo 2 | sha256sum
    53c234e5e8472b6ac51c1ae1cab3fe06fad053beb8ebfd8977b010655bfdd3c3  -
    #+END_SRC

* Independent verification

    source code + build environment + build instructions

    =

    bit-by-bit identical copies

    *anyone* can verify the result

https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/

* Reproducibility matters

  What kind of security implications are we facing?

  - *CVE-2002-0083*: Remote root exploit in OpenSSH,
    caused by an off-by-one error

  - 2015: *XcodeGhost*: malware variant of Apple's SDK Infected over
    4,000 apps in Apple's App store

* I Blame u-boot

 - u-boot was marked as reproducible
 - I knew it was wrong:

   U-Boot SPL 2016.01+dfsg1-3 (*Feb 21 2016 - 21:39:10*)

* timestamps: Please No

  There's no timestamps like *NO* timestamps.

* timestamps: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH

  Last resort: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH

  https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/

* locales

  - Sort order for C, as spoken in UNIX:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      $ printf 'a\nB\nb\nA\n' | LC_ALL=C sort
        A
        B
        a
        b
    #+END_SRC

  - Sort order for English, as spoken in USA:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      $ printf 'a\nB\nb\nA\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 sort
        a
        A
        b
        B
    #+END_SRC

  https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/locales/

* file sort order

  - Bad Makefile:
  #+BEGIN_SRC Makefile
  SRCS = $(wildcard *.c)
  tool: $(SRCS:.c=.o)
  	$(CC) -o $@ $^
  #+END_SRC

  - Good Makefile:
  #+BEGIN_SRC Makefile
  SRCS = $(sort $(wildcard *.c))
  tool: $(SRCS:.c=.o)
  	$(CC) -o $@ $^
  #+END_SRC

  https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/stable-inputs/

* build path

  - Can be normalized in build environment
  - Ongoing work to GCC and other major toolchains by Ximin Luo and
    others:
    - Some patches to GCC accepted, more in progress
    - draft specification: BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP in progress

* A typical build farm

* Alive and kicking

 - In September 2015, the network went live, building around 200
   source packages a day.
 - With over 25,000 packages in the Debian archive, it would take well
   over 100 days to build everything in Debian unstable...
