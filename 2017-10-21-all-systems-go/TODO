computer science, you take some inputs, you apply a process, you aspect the same result.

shorten debian summary
	change (and shorten) description of t.r-b.o into a (boring^wshort) "review about status quo"
		then emphasize we need funding for all teh cool things planned
	funding situation unclear, help welcome
		emphasize maintaince needs funding too, mayne also at the beginning?

status golang
        works
        except build path…
        https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-golang/golang.git/tree/debian/patches/0002-reproducible-BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP.patch?h=golang-1.9
                depends on gcc patch, which is not upstream
                so this hasnt been tried
	BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP
		quote: " This specification describes the environment variable BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP for build tools to exchange information about the build-time filesystem layout, to generate reproducible output where all embedded paths are independent of that layout."

update suse - at 93% too!
        no user tooling yet, no infrastructure.
	no wide commitment yet

update Fedora

update list of contriburs
	or add a slide: those are only Debian people and not updated since half a year
update graphs
update numbers
new slide: rws3 with pic from rws2
next big shiny thing, needs funding too

maybe start talk with / got somthing similar now

start with a summary of debians success
	and explain this
	(those are the slides from the end of the debian part)
	then "misleading success"
	then reproducible in debian are my example, its the most advanced and thats a problem actually
	        because i know of no other distro that commited
        	all others are lagging behind :/
		but you can start catching up now, but the challange is not to get to the 94%
			its the 100% 
			the infrastrctuzre
			the user tools
then explain what we have
	prefaced by this needs maintenance, which needs funding too



tell a story or 3
how to do a backslash in tex?

put this into the weekly blog:
	status arch
	        needed patches merged into pacman.git/master
        	also needs devtools changes which are prepared in anthraxx local git clone
                	SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set to an arbitrary date during build (=not derived from source code)
        	will release when its ready ;)
       		 .buildinfo files are part of Arch linux binary packages (.pkg.xz)
                	(=dont contain checksums of binaries nor depends
			do contain checksum of PKGBUILD file which contains checksums of upstream sources
	        no user tooling yet, no infrastructure.
