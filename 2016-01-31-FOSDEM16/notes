2015: 1 reproducible talk
2016: 3 talks:
        https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/reproducible_ecosystem/
        https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/reproducible_freebsd_packages/
        https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/electrobsd/

aim for 60 slides or less

mention/empasize: notes + bugs (+ future collaboration)

explain shortcuts:
        defined build environment with little variations
        subsets

I hope that Debian 9, "stretch", will be partially reproducible in a meaningful way
and sid as a easter present

end: come to K.4.601 at 14:35 and 15:40

go through slides look for reproducible.debian.net confusionâ€¦

future about tests.r-b.o slide: polish

"last year we had 70 issues (now 180), but instead we rather present progress in 10 projects"
