really show live demo there? :)
aim for 60 slides or less (talk slot is 50min, give time for questions)
1024x768 

open nothing in browser, have all the screenshots ready
- issue page
- one issue in detail
- adequate pkg page
- adequate diff page
- archlinux/freebsd/coreboot/openwrt pages
- dashboard
- spec
- howto
- (have torbrowser open and pages loaded to be able to show things)

the whole wrld is watching? no (not that slide, but its true…)
fosdem 2014 lunar in a dev room
fosdem 2015 lunar and holger in k building
fosdem 2016 holger in janson
will 2016 be the year of the reproducible llinux desktop? maybe
or 2017?! (i think so, find a nice pic to prove it)
and mayne not on the desktop, but just servers
or 85% of Debian main ;-)
or something - i'll get into the details later

cleanup finish / beyond reproducible builds

explain how recreating the build env has not been solved everywhere

explain shortcuts:
        defined build environment with little variations
        subsets

I hope that Debian 9, "stretch", will be partially reproducible in a meaningful way
and sid as a easter present

go through slides look for reproducible.debian.net confusion…

future about tests.r-b.o slide: polish

update graphs

20k reproducible source packages in main alone!


look up recent IOS fail / attack
