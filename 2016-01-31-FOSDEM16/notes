really show live demo there? :)
aim for 60 slides or less (talk slot is 50min, give time for questions)
1024x768 

open nothing in browser, have all the screenshots ready
- issue page
- one issue in detail
- adequate pkg page
- adequate diff page
- archlinux/freebsd/coreboot/openwrt pages
- dashboard
- spec
- howto
- (have torbrowser open and pages loaded to be able to show things)

the whole wrld is watching? no (not that slide, but its true…)
fosdem 2014 lunar in a dev room
fosdem 2015 lunar and holger in k building
fosdem 2016 holger in janson
will 2016 be the year of the reproducible llinux desktop? maybe
or 2017?! (i think so, find a nice pic to prove it)
and mayne not on the desktop, but just servers
or 85% of Debian main ;-)
or something - i'll get into the details later

cleanup finish / beyond reproducible builds

explain how recreating the build env has not been solved everywhere

explain shortcuts:
        defined build environment with little variations
        subsets

I hope that Debian 9, "stretch", will be partially reproducible in a meaningful way
and sid as a easter present

go through slides look for reproducible.debian.net confusion…

future about tests.r-b.o slide: polish

future: want more archs. 64gb absolute minimum. but where are the arm64 clouds?
	mail pema, ask for those 200gb diskspace and future commitments… oder ruf sie an?
		derzeit reichen die ressourcen…

future
	funding
	another meeting or two in 2016
	fosdem devroom in 2017?!
