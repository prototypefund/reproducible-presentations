really show live demo there? :)
aim for 60 slides or less (talk slot is 50min, give time for questions)
1024x768 

open nothing in browser, have all the screenshots ready
- issue page
- one issue in detail
- dashboard
- spec
- howto
- (have torbrowser open and pages loaded to be able to show things)

the whole world is watching? no (not that slide, but its true…)
fosdem 2014 lunar in a dev room
fosdem 2015 lunar and holger in k building
fosdem 2016 holger in janson
will 2016 be the year of the reproducible llinux desktop? maybe
or 2017?! (i think so, find a nice pic to prove it)
and mayne not on the desktop, but just servers
or 85% of Debian main ;-)
or something - i'll get into the details later

describe debian test setup
	debian repo

	debian bugs
	debian stats + pkgs sets
		armhf/testing done in 23 days
	check variations added

reproducible-builds.org/specs - the url is missing prominemtly... SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH

add SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH adoption outside Debian…

status other tests:
	not all variations debian has are applied, notable not yet date+time
	seperation of test logic and html page creation planned

2015: 1 reproducible talk
2016: 4 talks:
	saturday:
      	https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/deployments_with_gnu_guix/
	sunday:
	https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/reproducible_ecosystem/
        https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/reproducible_freebsd_packages/
        https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/electrobsd/
	

explain how recreating the build env has not been solved everywhere

explain shortcuts:
        defined build environment with little variations
        subsets

I hope that Debian 9, "stretch", will be partially reproducible in a meaningful way
and sid as a easter present

go through slides look for reproducible.debian.net confusion…

future about tests.r-b.o slide: polish
mention twitter.com/ReproBuilds

future: want more archs. 64gb absolute minimum. but where are the arm64 clouds?
	want more ressources

fix: only 1 hosts for other archs atm

many good sideeffects
	eg also arm bootloader improvements ;)

slide:
	this is not one persons work
	this is not one teams work
	this is 8 teams working together
		since half a year
		and really since early december
	so there's quite a lot of work in progress

future
	funding
	another meeting or two in 2016
	fosdem devroom in 2017?!
	tests.r-b.o doing rebuilds against releases

please help maintaining those distro tests
