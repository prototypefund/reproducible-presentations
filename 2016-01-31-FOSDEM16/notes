really show live demo there? :)



go through paper plans

end (or beginning?):
	the whole world is watching? no (not that slide, but its true… or maybe that slide indeed)
	fosdem 2014 lunar in a dev room
	fosdem 2015 lunar and holger in k building
	fosdem 2016 holger in janson
	will 2016 be the year of the reproducible linux desktop? maybe
	or 2017?! (i think so, find a nice pic to prove it)
	and mayne not on the desktop, but just servers
	or 85% of Debian main ;-)
	or something - i'll get into the details later

describe debian test setup
	debian repo
	debian bugs categories, nah
	debian stats
		armhf/testing done in 23 days
	mention variations from TODO
	
drop mentioning stip-nondeterminism

diffoscope can use debug symbols now

"identical build env" is non sense

go through reports since athens
add SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH adoption outside Debian…

need logos:
	fdroid
	qubes

make slides for each distro
	netbsd - FIXME: recreating the build env?
	coreboot - FIXME: recreating the build env?
	qubes 4.0
	fdroid
	unmentioned, with known activity:
		baserock
		nixos
		qubes
		bitcoin / tor
		gambling industry
	unmentioned, unknown activities?
		suse could reuse scripts
		ubuntu
		openbsd
		gentoo (stage1)
		you name it
		windows or any commercial vendor except gambling
			medicine
			arms
			critical infrastructure
			cars (hello VW)

dpkg: mention recent developments… same for ftp!
re-read: https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About etc

explain shortcuts:
        defined build environment with little variations
        subsets

    many good sideeffects
	eg also arm bootloader improvements ;)
	faster builds
	check our wiki page on that

future other tests:
	not all variations debian has are applied, notable not yet date+time
	seperation of test logic and html page creation planned

future
	funding
	another meeting or two in 2016
	fosdem devroom in 2017?!
	tests.r-b.o doing rebuilds against releases

prepare demo using screenshots

disclaimer:
	the mistakes are mine
	to better present this here,  chronologic order has been changed
	this is the work of *many* more people than mentioned, this is free software!
