nice to have: 
- look for nicer diffoscope screenshot
- variations:
    LANG=C 

- which is the agreed path?
	- so whats the agreed path - /buildd/ or /build/ or /buildd/debian or?
	- r.d.n uses /build/
	- taking https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=bash&arch=mipsel&ver=4.3-14&stamp=1441069691 as an example i think it was /home/buildd/build/bash-ukgiXS on that buildd

- todo next:
	send mail to that dam dak bug. NOW.
