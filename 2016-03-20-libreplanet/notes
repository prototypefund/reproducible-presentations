	build host
	signature
	signature changes between development and release

mention gsoc, new people

emphasize this is too much for me…
add thanks slide for all the people working on it in other projects

end (or beginning?):
	the whole world is watching? no (not that slide, but its true… or maybe that slide indeed)

	seperation of test logic and html page creation planned

future
	funding
	another meeting or two in 2016
	fosdem devroom in 2017?!
	tests.r-b.o doing rebuilds against releases

disclaimer:
	the mistakes are mine
	to better present this here,  chronologic order has been changed
	this is the work of *many* more people than mentioned, this is free software!
